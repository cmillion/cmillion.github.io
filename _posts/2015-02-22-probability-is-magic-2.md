Ritual magic is the manipulation of symbols (a grammer or _grimoire_) to the purpose of gaining insight (_gnosis_) or influencing the Prior.

The toolkit of ritual magic includes (but is not limited to):
* Mathematics and symbolic logic.
* Music. (e.g. chanting, Dylan)
* Precise, rehearsed, or repetitive action. (e.g. cooking, sport, ikebana)
* Writing of poetry and prose.
* Deception. (e.g. storytelling, conjuring)
