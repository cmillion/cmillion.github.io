title: Rules of Life
---
These are my personal rules for life, first conceived _ca._ 2010. They hang above the door to my office.

They are hierarchical (like the Laws of Robotics).

#### Rules of Life
    00 - Quick or painless.
    01 - Don't die.
    02 - Don't be a dick.
    03 - Have as much fun as possible.
