I am the the eponymous founder of [Million Concepts](http://www.millionconcepts.com).

**Rules of life:** (0) Quick or painless. (1) Don't die. (2) Don't be a dick. (3) Have as much fun as possible.

**Goals of work:** (1) Do interesting things, (2) mostly on my own terms, and (3) be appropriately recognized or compensated for them.

**Disclaimer:** I'm unlikely to provide legitimately new perspective on any topics covered here or elsewhere. But I don't have colleagues down the hall with whom I can discuss this stuff over coffee, and I need to get it out somehow. I'm also almost certainly wrong about everything all of the time. I'm cool with that. I try to become slightly less wrong, on average, over time.
